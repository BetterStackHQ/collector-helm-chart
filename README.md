Better Stack collector is the easiest and recommended way of integrating Better Stack into your Kubernetes cluster. 

**Leverage eBPF to instrument your Kubernetes** to gather logs, metrics, and OpenTelemetry traces **without code changes**. Ingest everything at a fraction of the cost. [Learn more ⇗](https://betterstack.com/tracing)

## System Requirements

### Memory Requirements

The Better Stack collector runs as a DaemonSet with two containers per node:
- **Collector container**: 512MB-2GB memory
- **Beyla container** (eBPF tracing): 1.5GB memory reserved

**Minimum recommended node specifications:**
- 4GB total memory per node
- 2GB available memory after system and other critical workloads

**Important notes:**
- The Beyla container requires 1.5GB memory reservation to ensure stable eBPF-based tracing
- In memory-constrained or heavily overcommitted clusters, the collector may experience restarts
- Both containers are configured with Guaranteed QoS class to prevent eviction under memory pressure
